### Basics of HTML:
- HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
- HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
- HTML describes the structure of a Web page
- HTML consists of a series of elements
- HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
- HTML elements are represented by tags
- HTML tags label pieces of content such as "heading", "paragraph", "table", and so on
- Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to render the content of the page

### Tags in HTML:
- HTML tags are keywords (tag names) surrounded by angle brackets like <html></html>
- HTML tags normally come in pairs like <p> and </p>
- The first tag in a pair is the start tag, the second tag is the end tag
- The end tag is written like the start tag, but with a forward slash inserted before the tag name
- Start and end tags are also called opening tags and closing tags

### The root element:
- The <html> element is the root element of an HTML page
- The <html> element is the container for all other HTML elements (except for the <!DOCTYPE> declaration)

### Basics of CSS
- CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
- CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
- CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
- External stylesheets are stored in CSS files
- CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes
   
### Syntax:
- A CSS rule-set consists of a selector and a declaration block
- The selector points to the HTML element you want to style
- The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons
- Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon
- A CSS declaration always ends with a semicolon, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces
